## 🚀 Overview
**Secure Storage 🔒** is a WebAssembly (WASM) module written in Rust that provides secure, high-performance encryption and decryption capabilities using the **ChaCha20-Poly1305** AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) algorithm. This project is ideal for securely storing and transmitting sensitive data in web applications.

## ✨ Features
1. ✅ **End-to-end Encryption** - Uses the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher for secure data encryption.
2. ✅ **WASM Powered** - High-performance cryptographic operations in the browser.
3. ✅ **Lightweight & Fast** - Rust’s efficiency ensures minimal overhead.
4. ✅ **Authenticated Encryption** - Ensures data integrity and authenticity.

## 📥 Installation
Ensure you have Rust and `wasm-pack` installed:

```sh
cargo install wasm-pack
```

Clone the repository and build the WASM package:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-storage.git
cd secure-storage
```
### 🛠️ Generate package
```Sh
wasm-pack build --target web 
```

## 📚 API Reference
#### `set_item(key: string, data: string) => void`
Generates and sets the encrypted data in the localstorage

#### `get_item(key: string) => string`
Gets the decrypted data in the localstorage

#### `remove(key: string) => void`
Removes the key from localstorage

#### `clear() => void`
Clears the localstorage
